UTF-8 Validation
This script contains a function validUTF8() that determines if a given data set represents a valid UTF-8 encoding.

Prototype
Copy code
def validUTF8(data)
Input
data: a list of integers representing the bytes of the data
Output
Return: True if data is a valid UTF-8 encoding, False otherwise
Functionality
A character in UTF-8 can be 1 to 4 bytes long. The data set can contain multiple characters. Each integer in the input list represents 1 byte of data, therefore the function only needs to handle the 8 least significant bits of each integer.

Example
Copy code
data = [65]
print(validUTF8(data))
# True

data = [80, 121, 116, 104, 111, 110, 32, 105, 115, 32, 99, 111, 111, 108, 33]
print(validUTF8(data))
# True

data = [229, 65, 127, 256]
print(validUTF8(data))
# False
How it works
The function iterates through the list of integers, which represent the bytes of the data. It uses bitwise operators to check the first few bits of each byte to determine if it is a valid UTF-8 character. If any invalid byte is found, the function immediately returns False. If the entire list of bytes is processed without finding any invalid bytes, the function returns True, indicating that the data is a valid UTF-8 encoding.

Note
It's important to make sure that you are using the right version of python, as this code uses python3.
